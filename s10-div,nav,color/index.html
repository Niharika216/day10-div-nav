        made his debut for the Indian cricket team on 23 December 2004 in an ODI
        against Bangladesh and played his first test a year later against Sri
        Lanka. In 2007, he became the captain of the ODI side before taking over

        Champions League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014. Dhoni is amongst the few
        batsmen to have scored more than five thousand runs in the IPL, as well
        as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.
        <br />
        <br />

        called one of the most commercially viable athletes, and is often ranked
        among the highest-paid globally.
      </p>
      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu
        family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and
        his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
        Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.Kohli's formative years were spent in
        Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public
        School.According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for
        cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request
        his father to bowl to him.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of
        that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for
        cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him
        to meet Rajkumar Sharma.Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's
        father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy,
        as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just
        playing in gully cricket.Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of
        being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly
        due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to
        relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his
        selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way
        into the under-15 Delhi team.He received training at the academy while
        simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy
        located at Vasundhara Enclave.In pursuit of furthering his cricketing
        career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade
        education.
        <br />
        <br />
        On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a
        cerebral attack.During his childhood, his father played a crucial role
        in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the
        one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings
        of missing his father's presence at times. According to his mother,
        Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took
        cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and
        deicating himself fully to the sport.Kohli's family resided in Meera
        Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to
        Gurgaon.
      </p>
      <h2>Player profile</h2>
      <hr />
      <b style="font-size: larger">Comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar</b>
      <br />
      <p>
        Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn
        comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who he regarded as the
        epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's
        "successor",[19][20] he is widely considered to have the potential to
        surpass his records in the future.[21][22] His reverence for Tendulkar
        as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to
        emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror
        Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit
        sixes in a similar manner.[23] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has
        earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who
        has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[24] He
        has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a
        former Australian cricketer.While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has
        noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,Kohli's skills
        with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great
        Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world
        alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a discourse with the prominent Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar
        proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of
        100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting
        aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs. In
        2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of
        an era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the
        team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been
        gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned the
        thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b style="font-size: larger">Playing style</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical
        abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.His customarily batting
        position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested
        stance,and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been
        noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his
        propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in
        high-pressure situations.In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour
        playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is
        appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent
        prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he
        considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude
        for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards
        leg stump.Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting
        technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily
        yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.Kohli is
        known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He
        scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also
        possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination
        of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative
        angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[38] Kohli is also a
        proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and
        sure-handedness.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of
        the off-stump.Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with
        such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.This vulnerability
        has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.Cricket experts
        such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have
        acknowledged this weakness,and former New Zealand cricketer Richard
        Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to
        out-swinging deliveries.Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and
        recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts
        and aficionados alike.In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when
        batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first.He has amassed 27 of his
        50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,and holds the record for the most hundreds
        scored when batting second.In reference to his success while batting
        second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing,
        relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to
        efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.His
        colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and
        work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b style="font-size: larger">Aggression</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that
        extends to his leadership on the field. He is well known for his
        passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating
        a fierce competitiveness.His captaincy is characterized as proactive,
        taking bold decisions and leading the team by example.[56] Kohli has
        been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early
        stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant
        individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former
        cricketers alike.While some have praised his assertiveness and
        confidence,others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the
        boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a
        loss of composure.Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour,
        Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or
        high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the
        cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a
        source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the
        field.Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's
        self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to some former Indian
        cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive
        politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative
        demeanour both on and off the cricket field.

        and leadership skills. Sharma holds several batting records which
        famously include most sixes in international cricket,[a] most double
        centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World Cups (7)
        and joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is
        the first player to score 5 T20I centuries.[6] He plays for Mumbai

        captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles in 2013, 2015,
        2017, 2019 and 2020 under his leadership, making him the most successful
        captain in IPL history, sharing this record with MS Dhoni (5 title wins
        in IPL). With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007
        T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the
        finals of both tournaments. Rohit is one of four players to have played
        in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in
        2007 to the latest one in 2022. Sharma currently holds the world record
        for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International (ODI)
        match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in
        ODIs and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a
        single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer
        of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has received two national honours, the
        Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna
        Award in 2020 by the Government of India. Under his captaincy, India won
        the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth time the
        country won the title, both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas
        Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I format.

      <h4>Early Life</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra,
        India.[7] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra
        Pradesh.[8] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a
        transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and
        uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit
        his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during
        weekends. He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma. His mother
        tongue is Telugu.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad,
        his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school to Swami
        Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket
        facilities were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma
        recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a
        scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my
        cricket".[10] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit
        before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number
        eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield
        school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.
